Hi there,

My name is Joan Calabrés and I'm the author of this blog. I work as a Security Engineer on a cibersecurity laboratory.

During my professional career I've been doing reverse engineering on mobile applications and malware. 

I made this blog to expose interesting stuff about reverse engineering and security in general.
