Hi there,

My name is Joan Calabrés and I'm the author of this blog. I work as a Reverse Engineer on an IT Laboratory.

I'm focused on Mobile Security, most of the time in Android Application Security.

I made this blog to expose different articles about reverse engineering.

Enjoy and have a nice reversing day!
