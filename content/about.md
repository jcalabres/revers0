Hi there,

My name is Joan Calabrés, I'm the author of this blog and I work as a Cybersecurity Analyst on a cybersecurity laboratory.

During my professional career I've been doing multiple cybersecurity projects, mostly related with reverse engineering on mobile applications and mobile malware.

As a Cybersecurity professional, I always think we are a non-ending learners, eternal apprentices. This blog is focused on cybersecurity learning using the KISS (Keep it simple, stupid) philosophy.

The content of this blog is related with my personal cybersecurity interests and also related with the last things I'm working on, with the main objective of exposing cybersecurity to everyone.

Have a fun and healthy hacking!
