Greetings,

I'm Joan Calabrés, the individual behind this blog. Throughout my career, I've been involved with various companies, working as a reverse engineer and malware analyst, specifically focused on mobile applications.

The main point of this blog is to share what I've learned. I want to turn it into a place where I can share my knowlege and provide useful tools to the community. 

If you want to support my work and content, you can invite me for a coffee! Thanks!
